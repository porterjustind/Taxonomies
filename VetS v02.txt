					233FP – Elevated Landforms "To reduce file name sizes where there will likely be more sub-folders (e.g. 233JF* - Mountains) it would be better to give it a dedicated code (e.g. 233JFM, for mountain to make it somewhat alphabetical, or 233JFF if it's likely one of the most referenced and used things that's good to have at the top). The problem with this vs using a 'Z' designator is the simple fact that there are more entities within the folder "233JF - Elevated Landforms" than the alphabet can encode for (i.e. more than 26 entities). If that number is exceeded, it will then be necessary to create new folders that will help break things up (e.g. Small Elevated Landforms, Medium Elevated Landforms, Large Elevated Landforms)."

		9F - Templates "A Templates smart folder and MOC should be placed here so they can be easily reviewed when building new notes. I might not remember that I have a template for something or where that template may be otherwise. Templates should be labeled "Descriptor Code Template.md"; the "Descriptor" is the name of Core General Note; and the "Code" is the Alphanumeric Code where the Core General Note resides, NOT where the Template resides (e.g. Molecule 232EF Template.md; this template resides in the folder titled 232EFB Assets, the Core General Note is titled Molecule.md and resides in folder titled 232EF Molecular Fundamentals). If I do decide to organize them within the hierarchy I can do a search for Template.md and get an alphabetical list of them wherever they may be located and I can isolate based off of domain. The Template itself will be located in the Assets folder that is collocated with the Core General Note regarding the Template (e.g. Molecule.md is located in 232EF. The Assets folder for 232EF is 232EFB. Therefore the template will be located in 232EFB and titled as Molecule 232EF Template.md)"
